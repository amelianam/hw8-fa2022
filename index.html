        <p> My interest in Formula 1 started in 2020 when the pandemic first started out. When my family and I were quaranitining, we were looking for some shows to watch on Netflix. That is where we stumbled across this show called, Formula 1: Drive to Survive. My younger brother, dad, and I fell in love with the show! 
        </p>
        <p> I had always been interested in sports, but something about Formula 1 racing compelled me in a different way. I am excited to share more about my favorites teams and drivers! Stay tuned!
